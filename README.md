# Welcome to My Canine Kingdom!

  <h1>Hi, I’m Clyde!</h1>

## About Me
Woof woof! I’m **Clyde**, a purebred American Pit Bull Terrier, born on April 16, 2024. I weigh 53 lbs and stand 1.8 feet tall—perfect for zooming and cuddling! I’m all about love and play, and I’ve got a big personality to match.

- **Who I Am**: I’m playful, loving, and super affectionate. I bark with a sturdy voice and love to alert with my paw—I’m great at sniffing out anything interesting! I miss my boy human, but my dad human is always around the corner to keep me company.  
- **What I Love**: Running fast, learning tricks for treats (I know about 10 on command!), and hiking with my human—we explore the Appalachian Trail and local spots, plus we go camping! I also love napping with my toys, snuggling under a blanket, and watching TV—*Regular Show* is my fave, especially Rigby!  
- **My Routine**: We walk every morning and afternoon, and on my human’s days off, we go for long hikes. I’m a healthy eater with a breakfast and dinner schedule—yummy veggies, protein like chicken or beef, rice, and eggs for breakfast. I’ve got free roam of the house and can go outside whenever I ask—woof!  
- **My Training**: My human’s teaching me to be an awesome Emotional Support Animal (ESA) or service dog. I’m picking up commands fast, so I might help with alerting or comfort someday!  
- **My Quirks**: I’ve still got all three balls (hehe!), and I’m super vocal—my barks and whines keep the house lively! I also play well with other dogs so far—love making new friends!  

## My Health Info
Gotta stay healthy to keep the fun going! Here’s my scoop:  
- **Shots**: I got my Rabies 1-year shot on 10/21/2024 (good until 10/21/2025), plus my DA2PP booster, NexGard for fleas/ticks, and ProHeart for heartworms.  
- **Feeling Good**: No big health problems yet—yay!  
- **Neutering**: Not neutered yet (as of May 2025).  
- **Vet Visits**: My first checkup was 10/21/2024 at the Animal Protective Foundation; next one’s coming soon!  
- **Microchip**: I’ve got one to bring me home if I get lost.  

## My Family
I’ve got an awesome crew! My mom’s the gentle one who keeps us calm, my dad’s the strong guy with a big build, and my grandma’s the wise one with all the tricks. They made me the playful pup I am—check their pic in my gallery!

## Fun Facts About Me
- I learn tricks in just a few treats—I know 10 already, pretty smart, huh?  
- I love car rides, lazy naps, and hikes—especially on the Appalachian Trail!  
- I always sleep with a toy in my mouth and a cozy blanket—it’s my happy place!  
- Watching *Regular Show* with Rigby is the best—I’m glued to the TV!
